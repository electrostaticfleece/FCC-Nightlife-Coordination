#Nightlife Coordination App

This is a Nightlife Coordination App created as part of [Free Code Camp's curriculum](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/build-a-nightlife-coordination-app). It was built using [Yelp's API](https://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/overview) along with the [reactGo](https://github.com/reactGo/reactGo) boilerplate, which uses the React library and the Redux framework to render the frontend, allows for universal rendering, and utilizes React Router for routing. 

The backend uses Node.js for its server side enviornment and Express for its web framework. Passport.js is used for user authentication and supports Google authentication. A demonstration of this application can be found at [https://rendezvous2.herokuapp.com](https://rendezvous2.herokuapp.com/).
